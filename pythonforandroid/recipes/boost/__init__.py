    .. note:: This recipe can be built only against API 21+ and an android
              ndk >= r19

    .. versionchanged:: 0.6.0
         Rewrote recipe to support clang's build. The following changes has
         been made:

            - Bumped version number to 1.68.0
            - Better version handling for url
            - Added python 3 compatibility
            - Default compiler for ndk's toolchain set to clang
            - Python version will be detected via user-config.jam
            - Changed stl's lib from ``gnustl_shared`` to ``c++_shared``

    .. versionchanged:: 2019.08.09.1.dev0

            - Bumped version number to 1.68.0
            - Adapted to work with ndk-r19+
