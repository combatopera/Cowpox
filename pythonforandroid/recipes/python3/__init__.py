    '''
    The python3's recipe
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The python 3 recipe can be built with some extra python modules, but to do
    so, we need some libraries. By default, we ship the python3 recipe with
    some common libraries, defined in ``depends``. We also support some optional
    libraries, which are less common that the ones defined in ``depends``, so
    we added them as optional dependencies (``opt_depends``).

    Below you have a relationship between the python modules and the recipe
    libraries::

        - _ctypes: you must add the recipe for ``libffi``.
        - _sqlite3: you must add the recipe for ``sqlite3``.
        - _ssl: you must add the recipe for ``openssl``.
        - _bz2: you must add the recipe for ``libbz2`` (optional).
        - _lzma: you must add the recipe for ``liblzma`` (optional).

    .. note:: This recipe can be built only against API 21+.

    .. versionchanged:: 2019.10.06.post0
        Added optional dependencies: :mod:`~p4as.libbz2`
        and :mod:`~p4as.liblzma`
    .. versionchanged:: 0.6.0
        Refactored into class
        :class:`~pythonforandroid.python.GuestPythonRecipe`
