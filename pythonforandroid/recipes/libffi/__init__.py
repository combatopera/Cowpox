    Requires additional system dependencies on Ubuntu:
        - `automake` for the `aclocal` binary
        - `autoconf` for the `autoreconf` binary
        - `libltdl-dev` which defines the `LT_SYS_SYMBOL_USCORE` macro

    .. note::
        Some notes about libffi version:

            - v3.2.1 it's from year 2014...it's a little outdated and has
              problems with clang (see issue #1525)
            - v3.3-rc0 it was released at april 2018 (it's a pre-release), and
              it lacks some commits that we are interested, specially those
              ones that fixes specific issues for Arm64, you can check those
              commits at (search for commit `8fa8837` and look at the below
              commits): https://github.com/libffi/libffi/commits/master
