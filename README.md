# Cowpox
Deploy Android apps written in Python
## Quick start
* To simply use Cowpox you shouldn't need to build anything as an image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/combatopera/cowpox)
* See [android-hello-world](https://github.com/combatopera/android-hello-world/blob/trunk/README.md) for an example project that Cowpox can turn into an Android APK
